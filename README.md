This repo was created to hold some of the experiments that I take on in CSS animation to create more of an engaging interphase with the audiance. This can consist of animations in text that animate to the screen letter by letter or it can simply be snippets of JavaScript that make things that are possable in CSS but are not easy to implement a whole lot easier.


### Upcoming Changes
- active type like on cody.pw will be added
- raining text animation is in the thought process
